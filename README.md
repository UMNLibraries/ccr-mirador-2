# CCR Mirador 2 Demo

A [Mirador 2](https://projectmirador.org/) proof of concept for the [Bernard and Picart's Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the World project](https://picartbernard.com/).

## Why Mirador 2?
At the moment, Mirador 3 is still in alpha, and the API may be subject to change. More importantly, Mirador 3 does not yet support creating annotations on images. 

## Demo Site
*Note: Annotations created in the demo site are only stored in your local browser.*
